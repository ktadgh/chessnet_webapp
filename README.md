# Predicting chess results and ELO ratings based on PGN data
[webapp available here](http://webapp-external14-dev.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com)

## Neural Network
Using a Recurrent Neural network (LSTM) to predict a player's ELO rating based on Stockfish's evaluation of a single game and time spent per move. The network takes per move clock times, accuracy, and the time control as input. Results of the model are shown below, compared to a basic linear regression model based on average accuracy. The model outperforms the average accuracy model in mean squared error, and also predicts a wider range of values.

In order to ensure that the model predicts a range of values similar to the true range of ELO values, a custom loss function was implemented for training:
```
def custom_loss(outputs, elo):
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()
    mse_loss = criterion(outputs,elo)
    sample_var = ((outputs - outputs.mean())**2).mean()
    true_var = ((elo - elo.mean())**2).mean()
    var_error = (sample_var-true_var)**2
    sample_kurt = ((outputs - outputs.mean())**4).mean()
    true_kurt = ((elo - elo.mean())**4).mean()
    kurt_error = (sample_kurt-true_kurt)**2

    return mse_loss+ kurt_error/20 + var_error/20
```

The neural net used 3 hidden layers each with 24 nodes. The final hidden layer of the nerual network was fed into a final linear layer with one output. The LSTM was bidirectional, and both the forward and backward final hidden layers are used in the linear layer.

## Blitz Project
Using logistic regression to predict the result of a chess game based on the players' ELO ratings and other factors.
The regression model returns the predicted probability of a win, loss and draw, and overall can predict the expected points more accurately
than the ELO alone.
